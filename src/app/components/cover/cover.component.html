  <h4>
    A little bit about myself
  </h4>
  <p>
    I love developing, there is something about creating an useful app that I find inspiring, I like to think that what I do makes the life of the users simpler, I also like the well written, readable code, as simple as can sound, it is no that common in my experience. I like working with other people, always is a good opportunity to learn and from others and teach them, is all about sharing knowledge.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have been IT manager, and I have been technical leader, but in the end a rather leading from developing, is just what I like the most.
  </p>
  <p>
    On the professional side I like a working environment where the company trust their employees, I don't like fixed schedules, I'm not necessarily more productive in the mornings.
  </p>
  <p>
    I really believe that the code you write speaks for you, whether is on behalf of you or against you depends on the passion you put to it.
